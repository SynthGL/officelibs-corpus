"""Spreadsheet (xlsx) content model: what a user of the workbook can observe.

`extract(path)` reads an OOXML spreadsheet package and returns a deterministic,
JSON-serializable model whose top-level keys are `FEATURES`. `compare(before,
after)` lists the differences between two models; an empty list means the
content was preserved. The model never records how a writer serialized the
content (part names, relationship ids, attribute order, shared vs inline
strings, style table layout, default values spelled out or omitted), so a
library that rewrites a workbook into an equivalent form scores exactly the
same as one that copies bytes.

Shared cross-format rule (identical in the xlsx, docx and pptx models)
- Presentation-only lengths compare equal when they differ by at most 0.5 pt.
  Color modifiers (tint, shade, lumMod-like values on a 0..1 or -1..1 scale)
  compare by rendered effect: equal when they differ by at most 1/510, so
  they cannot change an 8-bit channel by a full level. Other
  presentation-only floats that are not lengths (shading percentages,
  gradient geometry, scale factors) compare equal within a relative 1e-9.
  Everything else, including cell values, formula text, number formats, font
  sizes and every non-presentation number, compares exactly: data is data.
- xlsx lengths: column widths are in characters of the workbook default
  font, converted at 1 character = 7 px = 5.25 pt (tolerance 0.5 / 5.25 =
  0.095 characters); row heights (including the default row height) are in
  points (0.5); page margins and header/footer margins are in inches
  (0.5 / 72). Drawing anchor offsets are not part of the model (images and
  charts are anchored by cell), so the 6350 EMU tolerance has nothing to
  apply to.
- xlsx color modifiers: the `~tint:` of any color (an absent tint is 0, so
  `theme:1` equals `theme:1~tint:0.001`). xlsx relative floats: gradient
  fill parameters (degree, left/right/top/bottom, stop positions).
- Content-addressed entries (conditional formats, data validations) whose
  values are equal under these tolerances count as the same entry even
  though their exact hashes differ.
- Equivalent spellings compare equal because the model stores one canonical
  form. xlsx: SpreadsheetML style colors (fonts, fills, borders, dxf,
  conditional-format colors, color scales, data bars, tab colors, rich-text
  runs, indexed palette, theme scheme colors) are 6-digit uppercase RGB,
  because Excel ignores the alpha byte (`001F4E78` == `FF1F4E78` ==
  `1f4e78`); an indexed color equals the explicit RGB its palette entry
  holds; `auto`, indexed 64 and an absent color are all automatic; a tint of
  0 equals no tint. The model records no DrawingML colors, where alpha
  (a:alpha and other srgbClr modifiers) is real and would be kept.

Package rules
- Parts are matched case-insensitively with percent-decoding. Relationships are
  followed by type (the last path segment of the relationship type URI, so
  transitional and strict URIs agree) and resolved target. A relationship id is
  only used to dereference an `r:id` attribute inside the part that owns it;
  no rId value ever enters the model.
- Element and attribute names are compared by local name, so transitional and
  strict namespaces produce the same model.
- A file that is not a zip archive, has no workbook part, or contains XML that
  cannot be parsed raises `ValueError`. Relationships whose target part is
  absent are ignored (nothing observable is behind them).

Equivalence rules
- Absent == default. Every attribute with a documented default is either
  filled with it or dropped when equal to it, so writing a default explicitly
  never differs from omitting it.
- Dicts are keyed (set or map semantics, order ignored); lists are ordered and
  used only where order is user-visible (sheet order, rich-text runs, chart
  plots and series, table columns, comment threads, gradient stops, print
  areas, conditional-format formulas).
- Numbers are parsed to float and compared exactly, except for the
  presentation tolerances in the shared rule above.
- Colors: rgb as uppercase 6-digit RGB (the alpha byte of an 8-digit ARGB is
  dropped, see equivalent spellings), theme colors stay symbolic
  (`theme:N`), indexed colors resolve to RGB
  through the workbook's palette (custom indexedColors entries override the
  ECMA default palette by index; out-of-range indexes stay
  `indexed:N`; 65 is `system-background`), a non-zero tint is appended as
  `~tint:<float>`, and `auto`, indexed 64 (system foreground) and absent all
  mean automatic (None). Referenced theme colors are modeled under `theme`
  so symbolic colors stay comparable.
- Strings decode the OOXML `_xHHHH_` escape. Phonetic runs (`rPh`) are not
  text.
- Formulas: leading/trailing whitespace and one leading `=` are removed,
  everything outside string literals is upper-cased (Excel formulas are
  case-insensitive outside literals), unquoted sheet prefixes are quoted
  (`Sheet1!A1` == `'Sheet1'!A1`), and whitespace outside literals is dropped
  unless it separates two operands (the intersection operator), where it
  becomes one space. String literals and structured-reference brackets are
  kept verbatim apart from upper-casing the brackets. Shared formulas are
  expanded per cell by shifting the anchor formula's relative A1 references,
  so a writer that de-shares formulas compares equal.
- Ranges: `$` dropped, upper-cased, corners ordered, a one-cell range is the
  cell, a full-height range is a column range (`A:A`), a full-width range is a
  row range (`1:1`). Multi-area sqrefs (data validations, conditional
  formats) are canonicalized as the cell-set union decomposed into maximal
  row bands, so any split/merge/reorder of the same cells compares equal.

Feature rules
- workbook: sheet order (list of names), per sheet kind (worksheet,
  chartsheet, dialogsheet, macrosheet, or `missing` if the part is absent)
  and visibility (`visible` default), `date1904`.
- defined_names: keyed `<scope>!<name>` (scope is the sheet name for
  sheet-local names, empty for workbook names) -> normalized refers-to plus
  `hidden` when true. `_xlnm._FilterDatabase` is excluded (derived from the
  auto filter, modeled under auto_filters); `_xlnm.Print_Titles` and
  `_xlnm.Print_Area` are modeled under page_setup; other built-in names stay.
- cells: per sheet, address -> `{"type", "value"}` with type `n` (float), `s`
  (shared, inline and formula-string results all resolve to plain text), `b`
  (bool), `e` (error text). `t="d"` ISO dates become the numeric serial for the
  workbook's date system (1900 system keeps Excel's 1900-02-29 slot). Rich text
  adds `runs`: `[{"text", "font"}]` where each run's font is the cell font
  overridden by the run properties, adjacent runs with equal fonts merged; runs
  are dropped when every run renders in the cell font. Formula cells carry
  their cached result here (missing cached value == no cell entry); unparsable
  values are recorded as type `invalid`.
- formulas: per sheet, address -> `{"text"}` plus `array` (canonical ref) for
  array/dynamic-array anchors, or `data_table` (its attributes) for what-if
  tables.
- cell_styles: `default` is the resolved style of cellXfs[0]. Per sheet,
  address -> resolved style for every cell whose style differs from the style
  an absent cell would have there (the row style if the row has
  customFormat, else the column style, else the default). A style is
  `number_format` (format code; ECMA built-in ids and Excel's en-US codes
  for 41-44 mapped to their codes, other
  built-in ids kept as `builtin:N`; a backslash escape of a character that
  displays literally anyway, such as `\\-`, is dropped), `font` (name, size,
  bold, italic, underline, strike, color, vert_align), `fill` (pattern none
  drops colors, solid keeps only fg; gradients keep type, degree, edges,
  stops), `border`
  (left/right/top/bottom, style none drops color, `start`/`end` == left/right,
  diagonal only when diagonalUp/Down), `alignment` and `protection`, all with
  defaults filled. cellXfs values are used as-is (apply* flags ignored);
  font family/charset/scheme are not modeled. Merged areas: the anchor
  cell holds what the area renders, the anchor style with its border
  replaced by the per-cell perimeter sides (top of the top row, bottom of
  the bottom row, left/right of the outer columns; a uniform side collapses
  to one value); styles of covered cells and interior borders are not
  rendered and are dropped (covered cell values stay under cells). In the
  model, styles are content-addressed keys into `cell_styles.table`;
  `compare` expands them so differences are reported per style field and
  the table itself is never compared.
- merged_cells: per sheet, set of canonical ranges.
- columns: per sheet, maximal runs of adjacent columns with identical
  non-default properties (`width` when given, `hidden`, `outline_level`,
  `collapsed`, `style` when not the default), keyed `A:C`. `compare`
  re-keys both sides onto their common run boundaries first, so runs that
  split differently are compared column range by column range.
- rows: per sheet, row number -> non-default properties: `height` only when
  customHeight (a non-custom `ht` is an autofit result the application
  recomputes, so it is not compared), `hidden`, `outline_level`, `collapsed`,
  `style` when
  customFormat and not the default. Plus `_default` for a custom default row
  height / zeroHeight from sheetFormatPr.
- views: per sheet, first sheet view: frozen pane (`freeze` cols/rows from
  xSplit/ySplit when the pane state is frozen/frozenSplit), right_to_left,
  show_gridlines, show_headers, zoom, tab_color.
- auto_filters: per sheet, `ref` and filter column criteria (canonical dump
  keyed by column id).
- data_validations: per sheet, validations grouped by their parameters (type
  default `none`, operator default `between`, formulas, allow_blank,
  show_dropdown, input/error message flags, texts, error style) with the
  union of their sqrefs. Main and x14 extension validations are one set.
- conditional_formats: per sheet, set of rules (sqref, type, operator,
  formulas, priority rank within the sheet, differential style, stop_if_true,
  type-specific attributes with defaults dropped, color scale / data bar /
  icon set parameters, and linked x14 extension parameters). Priorities are
  replaced by their rank so renumbering is invisible. Only what the rule
  type reads is kept: operator for cellIs and the text rules, text for the
  text rules, timePeriod, rank/percent/bottom for top10,
  aboveAverage/equalAverage/stdDev for aboveAverage; formulas are dropped
  for aboveAverage, top10, duplicate/unique values, color scales, data bars
  and icon sets; cfvo `val` is dropped for min/max thresholds. Unlinked x14
  rules are too. Differential styles keep only what they set: a dxf fill
  without patternType is solid and its color is bgColor (else fgColor), a
  dxf border side without a style sets nothing, a dxf diagonal counts only
  with diagonalUp/Down. Parameter dumps (and auto filter criteria) map
  boolean `true`/`false` to `1`/`0` and drop documented defaults (data bar
  lengths, direction, axis, gradient, border, negative-bar flags; icon set
  name, custom, showValue, percent, reverse; cfvo gte).
- hyperlinks: per sheet, canonical ref -> external `target` and/or in-workbook
  `location` and `tooltip`.
- comments: per sheet, `notes` (address -> author, text) and `threads`
  (address -> ordered list of author display name, text). A legacy note on
  a cell that has a thread is the thread's compatibility shadow and is
  dropped.
- protection: workbook lock_structure/lock_windows; per sheet the
  sheetProtection `sheet` flag (chartsheets: `content`).
- page_setup: per worksheet orientation (`default` == portrait), paper_size,
  fit_to_page with fit_width/fit_height (or scale when not fitting), margins
  with Excel defaults, header/footer texts (`_xHHHH_` decoded, split into
  left/center/right sections by &L/&C/&R; text before any section code is
  center; empty sections dropped) and flags, print_titles
  (`rows`/`cols`), print_area (ordered list of canonical refs).
- images: per sheet, multiset `<anchor>|<sha256 of media bytes>` -> count,
  anchor being the from-cell of drawing anchors, `absolute`, or `background`
  for the sheet background picture. AlternateContent uses its first Choice.
- charts: per sheet, keyed by anchor (`#n` suffix for duplicates; chartsheets
  use `sheet`): plot types (bar charts carry their direction), title
  (`text`, `ref`, or `auto` when a title element has no text, which Excel
  fills automatically), series (name, values, categories, x/y, bubble sizes;
  references normalized and `$`-free) ordered by series order. ChartEx
  charts record their series layout ids.
- tables: per sheet, display name -> ref, columns, header/totals flags,
  style name and stripe flags.
- pivot_tables: per sheet, name -> location and cache source.
- external_links: number of external workbook links.
- vba: presence of a VBA project part.
- theme: `colors`: theme color index -> scheme color (`sysClr` resolves to
  its lastClr RGB; indexes 0-3 map to lt1, dk1, lt2, dk2) for the theme
  indexes the model actually references. Unreferenced theme colors and theme
  fonts are not observable through modeled content.

Not modeled: VML shapes, form controls, header/footer images, slicers,
sparklines, chart formatting beyond types/series/title, calculation chain,
document properties, workbook views, and the default column width (it
depends on font metrics).
